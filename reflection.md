In my development process, I utilized ChatGpt to give me a basic HTML template, I then used that and modified it to add the specific content that I needed. This made the development process go much quicker. I found it helpful especially when it came to specific content types like tables, I would ask ChatGpt to generate a simple table, then I'd modify it to add or delete any rows or columns that I need. I ran into some problems with formatting, specifically, I had an unordered list that I wanted to place in the center, however, the bullet points would not center but the content of the list items would. I decided to just omit that design choice and keep the unordered list on the left side of the page. Overall I found this assignment very fun, I appreciate the creative freedom.
