For this project, I used Tailwind CSS properties to style my portfolio. Most of the classes provided by Tailwind were already responsive, so I didn’t need to do much to address responsiveness. In my custom CSS file, I focused on maintaining a consistent style, using black and white as the main themes. 

Initially, I started my project using Bootstrap, but I struggled to make the navbar look good on mobile devices. Despite using ChatGPT to debug and modify my code, I couldn’t resolve the issue, so I decided to start over with Tailwind. 

Even with Tailwind, the navbar was a challenge. I went through multiple styles and eventually switched to using buttons for the directory links instead of plain text. I used ChatGPT to help align the buttons with Tailwind’s flex properties, which helped improve the overall look significantly. 

Throughout this project, I utilized ChatGPT to debug and modify my code but it was still sometimes frustrating since it involved a lot of back-and-forth. However, it helped me better understand how to use Tailwind properties and resolve styling issues.
