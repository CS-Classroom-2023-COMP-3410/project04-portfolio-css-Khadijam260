    <!-- my introduction -->
    <p>
        I'm Khadija Mohamed, a student at the University of Denver. I'm currently a senior and I'm majoring in Computer Science with minors in Business Administration and Mathematics. At the University of Denver, I'm involved on my campus by participating in groups and organizations such as serving as the President of the NSBE chapter, currently the secretary for MSA, and I am a scholar of the ESTEM program.

        My future goal is to use my education and skills to help people, whether that's through software or in other creative ways.
